**Outputs**
- Ranked list of backlog items
- RICE score per item
- Clear visibility of score drivers

---

### 5.3 MoSCoW Prioritization

The system groups backlog items into:
- Must
- Should
- Could
- Won’t

**Additional Checks**
- Flag excessive Must-haves
- Highlight missing Won’t-haves
- Encourage realistic scope discussions

---

### 5.4 Comparison View (Key Differentiator)

The system provides a side-by-side comparison of:
- RICE ranking
- MoSCoW category

**Example Insights**
- High-value items deprioritized due to strategic or compliance constraints
- RICE favors growth opportunities, MoSCoW favors obligations
- Misalignment between perceived urgency and economic value

---

## 6. Out of Scope (v1)

- Jira or tool integrations
- Multi-user collaboration
- Authentication or authorization
- Advanced analytics or machine learning predictions

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- Simple, lightweight UI (e.g. Streamlit)
- Works with small to medium backlogs (10–50 items)
- Fully explainable logic (no black-box scoring)
- Fast local execution and easy setup

---

## 8. Success Metrics

### Qualitative
- Users can clearly explain prioritization decisions
- Tool supports constructive prioritization discussions

### Quantitative
- Time to compare frameworks: under 5 minutes
- No manual recalculation required

---

## 9. Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions
- Users have basic Agile / Product knowledge
- Input values are estimates, not precise measurements

### Risks
- Scores treated as absolute truth
- Over-reliance on numbers instead of discussion

**Mitigation**
- Explicit guidance on when *not* to use each framework

---

## 10. Future Enhancements

- Add WSJF prioritization
- Stakeholder weighting
- Capacity constraints per sprint or release
- Export results as PDF for leadership discussions
- AI-generated facilitation questions and insights

---

## 11. Why This Project Exists

This project is not about finding the “best” prioritization framework.

It exists to:
- Make trade-offs visible
- Encourage better product conversations
- Support transparent, explainable decision-making
